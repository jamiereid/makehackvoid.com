Need to tell people when the Hackerspace is open for hacking? Use the Space Probe! It [tweets](//twitter.com/makehackvoid) & [emails](//www.makehackvoid.com/mailman/listinfo/makers) to let people know when the space opens and closes.

Before we had the Space Probe, people would write to the mailing list - but it's easy to forget to email, especially if you came in to work on non-computer-centric projects or if you need to leave in a hurry.

Here is a video about using the Space Probe:

Technical Summary
-----------------

The Space Probe is made out of a laboratory power supply that I spotted in a dumpster and looks like this:

Inside the probe enclosure is an Arduino clone wired in and using a [Freetronics EtherTen](//www.freetronics.com/products/etherten) as an HTTP server, for a simple web API ([More info](//www.makehackvoid.com/pipermail/makers/2012-December/004334.html)). On the router is a program written in Lua, which performs all of the probe's functions. [Source code is all online here](//github.com/makehackvoid/mhv-space-probe).

The server-side portion of the Space Probe configuration at MHV is [documented on the space wiki](//space.makehackvoid.com/wiki/ServerConfig#Space_Probe).
