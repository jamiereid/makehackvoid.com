**Where:** At MHV in Downer

The Ada Initiative Allies Workshop focuses on what individual people can do to make their workplace or community a better, more positive place for women. The workshop teaches people how to respond to sexism in a productive way, whether online, in the workplace, or in person. More [details about the workshop is available on the Ada Initiative site](https://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/workshops-and-training).

I'm happy to announce that Mary from the Ada Initiative will be coming to Canberra to run an Ada Initiative "Allies Workshop" for the MHV community.

The workshop is **free** and people of all genders are welcome to attend. Members of other open technology or open culture groups and communities are also welcome to attend.

Mary needs to get back to Sydney on Saturday night and has suggested that we consider having a group lunch before the workshop instead of dinner afterwards.

It is important that if you say you are coming you do attend (please contact me as soon as possible if something happens and you can't make it). We need a minimum number of 15 participants for the workshop to run, and it will be cancelled if we don't reach this.

The Ada Initiative generously provides the workshop for free to groups like MHV, but MHV does need to pay for Mary's return travel from Sydney. Please contact me if you are willing to help contribute towards this and I'll get back to you once the costs are known. I'd also like volunteers to help with organising and setting up the workshop on the day.

If you would like to attend, please RSVP via email. I need responses quickly so that I can book Mary's travel once we reach the minimum 15 people.
