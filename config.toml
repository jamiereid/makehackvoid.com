        description = "MakeHackVoid is modeled on an international community of like minded spaces that started in Germany in 1995. It supports and encourages arts, science and technology culture in the ACT by providing a physical space for Canberra residents, as well as national and international visitors to meet, interact and create. We hold public meetups most Tuesdays and an electronics group most Wednesdays from 7:00pm - please check the calendar/tweeter feed for announcements. These meetups are where we invite you to join us and chat, participate in show and tell, get help or advice, or talk about your projects. We are open at other times throughout the week for drop ins, workshops, general hacking and socialising; check the calendar for planned sessions and watch our twitter feed and announce mailing list for notifications of the space opening. Our group includes people with diverse backgrounds and interests. MakeHackVoid is dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone. See our Code of conduct.   If you can’t make it to the next meeting then join the conversation on the Forum, follow us on Twitter, Facebook, or join us in the IRC channel."
